## domino style game meant to represent a Kung Fu type fight
*  Grab beats Block  
*  Block beats Strike 
*  Stike beats Grab.
Simulate the flow of a series of strikes and reactions.
A series of attacks and counters that flow in a Martial Arts match.

Each tile represents a form that offers two possible courses of action.
From that form your opponent knows your two possible moves. Then the other player 
will pick their tile (form). Following with that player selecting an action. The first 
player then finishing up the round with their last choice.  Round resolves.

When a player lands an attack they have advantage. If a player can score from advantage they win the game. It is possible to counter advantage from the opponent and regain advantage for yourself. Each tile (form) chosen is eliminated from the possible tiles and can only be used once.

The idea is to force your opponent into limited predictable moves towards the end that you are prepared for.
