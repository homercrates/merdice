# Dice Fu 
## WIP  react JS 

## I have a few more tweaks to make Work In Progress

## dice / domino style game meant to represent a king fu type fight
Grab beats Block.  Block beats Strike, Stike beats Grab
It is too simulate the flow of a series of strikes and reactions.
A series of attacks and counters that flow in a Martial Arts match.

Each tile represents a form that offers two possible courses of action.
From that form your opponent knows your two possible moves.  Then the other player 
will pick their tile (form).  Following with that player selecting the action and the first 
player then finishing up the round with their choice.

When a player lands an attack they have advantage.  If a player can score from advantage they 
win the game.  It is possible to counter advantage from the opponent and regain advantage for yourself.
Each tile (form) chosen is eliminated from the possible tiles and can only be used once.

## need to update the images still, and probably do a bit more styling.
